Running on Theta
****************

.. note::

    The examples so far assume that your DeepHyper models run in the same Python
    environment as DeepHyper and each model runs on a single node.  If you need more control over model execution, say, to run containerized models, or to run data-parallel model training with Horovod, you can hook into the Balsam job controller. See :ref:`balsamjob_spec`  for a detailed example.


.. note::

    Also make sure not to change any of our workflow names or directory structures as this is crucial for accurate node utilization assessments when using ``deephyper-analytics``.

Hyperparameter Search
==========================

First we are going to run a search on the ``deephyper.benchmark.hps.polynome2``
benchmark. In order to achieve this goal we must load the DeepHyper
module on Theta. This module is not only bringing DeepHyper into you current environment,
but also the Cray Python distribution and the Balsam software::

    module load deephyper

Then, you can create a new Postgres database in the current directory; this
database is used by the Balsam software::

    balsam init testdb

Once the database has been created you can start it or link to it if
it is already running::

    source balsamactivate testdb

The database is now running. Let's define our first Balsam application
in order to run a Asynchronous Model-Based Search (AMBS)::

    balsam app --name AMBS --exec "$(which python) -m deephyper.search.hps.ambs"

You can run the following command to print all the applications available
in your current Balsam environment::

    deephyper balsam-submit hps test -p deephyper.benchmark.hps.polynome2.Problem -r deephyper.benchmark.hps.polynome2.run \
    -t 60 -q debug-cache-quad -n 4 -A datascience -j mpi

This creates an AMBS hyperparameter search job for the given `Problem` and `run` arguments.  The parameters on the second line
indicate: 60 minute wall-time, submission to `debug-cache-quad` queue, running on 4 nodes, charging to `datascience` allocation,
and using the `mpi` job mode of Balsam. Refer to the Command Line Interface documentation for more information on this command.
Create a new job::

You can use ``balsam ls`` to see the job that was added to the database::

    balsam ls jobs

Now if you want to look at the logs, go to ``testdb/data/TEST``. You'll see
one directory prefixed with ``test``. Inside this directory you will find the
logs of your search. All the other directories prefixed with ``task`` correspond
to the logs of your ``--run`` function, here the run function is corresponding
to the training of a neural network.
.. note::

    In our case we are setting ``PROJECT_NAME`` to *datascience*::

        export PROJECT_NAME=datascience

Finally, you can submit a Cobalt job to Theta which will start by running
your master job named test::

    balsam submit-launch -n 128 -q default -t 180 -A $PROJECT_NAME --job-mode serial --wf-filter TEST

Each Balsam job runs in its own working directory, which is generated from the ``workflow``
and ``name`` attributes as follows: ``testdb/data/{workflow}/{name}_{id}``. In the context of
DeepHyper, we want to follow the output of the search task.
Navigate to the ``TEST`` workflow directory ``testdb/data/TEST``.  Here, you'll see
one directory prefixed with ``test`` corresponding to the AMBS application that we named ``test``.
Inside this directory you will find the DeepHyper search logs.

Each evaluation of the ``--run`` function in the course of a search counts as a separate Balsam job
prefixed with ``task``.  Therefore, the directories matching ``testdb/data/TEST/task*`` will contain
the individual logs of each run function evaluation. Here, the run function
corresponds to the training of a neural network and returns a suitable fitness metric such as
the trained model's validation accuracy.

The above specification of Balsam ``--job-mode=serial`` can be used for tasks that **do
not** use MPI (and hence are restricted to a single node). With the current settings,
Balsam executes a ``Master`` orchestrator process on the entirety of the first node, and
each of the remaining 127 nodes will execute isolated DeepHyper "workers". One worker
(compute node) will execute the AMBS searcher/learner process. The remaining 126 compute
nodes will execute independent evaluators defined by
``deephyper.benchmark.hps.polynome2.run``. Only a single call to the job scheduler's
``mpirun``-equivalent command is made at the beginning of ``submit-launch`` command; jobs
are run as forked processes on all of the ``Worker`` ranks.

DeepHyper automatically infers the number of available workers from the Balsam environment
variables ``BALSAM_LAUNCHER_NODES`` and ``BALSAM_JOB_MODE``. Additionally, the user can
define the ``DEEPHYPER_WORKERS_PER_NODE`` environment variable to pack multiple
*evaluator* tasks per node in this Balsam job mode. In that case, the
``--node-packing-count`` option of ``balsam job`` (which controls the fraction of a node
occupied by the AMBS searcher) should typically be changed from its default value of 1 to
be consistent with the environment variable and ensure full job occupancy of the
``Worker`` ranks. For example, to run 4 DeepHyper "workers" (searcher and evaluators) per
node, the above command is modified::

  balsam job --name test --application AMBS --workflow TEST --node-packing-count=4 --env DEEPHYPER_WORKERS_PER_NODE=4 --args '--evaluator balsam --problem deephyper.benchmark.hps.polynome2.Problem --run deephyper.benchmark.hps.polynome2.run'

By setting the two parameters equal to 4, the searcher (AMBS) and a single evluator process
occupy equal fractions of a node. The resulting behavior is as follows:
  - ``Node0`` executes the ``Master`` orchestrator process
  - ``Node1`` executes the AMBS searcher process and 3x DeepHyper evaluators
  - ``Node2, ..., Node126`` each execute 4x DeepHyper evaluators

If a user wishes to allocate more compute resources to the searcher process relative to
the evaluators, the two parameters can be toggled independently e.g.::

  balsam job --name test --application AMBS --workflow TEST --node-packing-count=2 --env DEEPHYPER_WORKERS_PER_NODE=4 --args '--evaluator balsam --problem deephyper.benchmark.hps.polynome2.Problem --run deephyper.benchmark.hps.polynome2.run --n-jobs=2'

The resulting allocation would be:
  - ``Node0`` executes the ``Master`` orchestrator process
  - ``Node1`` executes the AMBS searcher process (2x cores) and 1x DeepHyper evaluator
  - ``Node2, ..., Node126`` each execute 4x DeepHyper evaluators


.. note::
   If Balsam is launched in this mode with only one node, ``balsam submit-launch -n 1
   ...``, the ``Master`` process will share the node with 4x DeepHyper workers. It will
   not contribute to the worker node occupancy calculations in Balsam.

The default Balsam job mode is ``--job-mode=mpi``. There are several key differences
when compared with the serial job mode:
1. The tasks may or may not use MPI (and multiple nodes).
2. No more than one task can be executed on a node at a time (current restriction).
   - Hence, ``DEEPHYPER_WORKERS_PER_NODE`` should be set to 1.
3. The launcher runs on the head node (or Machine Oriented Mini-server (MOM) node on
   Theta) and continuously submits jobs using the ``mpirun``-equivalent command for the
   given job scheduler. There is no notion of a ``Master`` process that consumes a compute
   node.

Neural Architecture Search
==========================

There are three main algorithms for effective search over the potentially vast space of neural architectures explorable by NAS. These are through the use of reinforcement learning given by the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (henceforth denoted PPO), an evolutionary algorithm (EVO) that encodes neural architectures into gene-like sequences and performs mutations/crossovers to obtain "fitter" networks and a random search that randomly explores this large search space. We can add these algorithms as applications to Balsam. To add them we can use:

::

    balsam app --name PPO --exec "$(which python) -m deephyper.search.nas.ppo"
    balsam app --name EVO --exec "$(which python) -m deephyper.search.nas.regevo"
    balsam app --name RAN --exec "$(which python) -m deephyper.search.nas.full_random"

::

To submit a neural architecture search on theta that uses PPO we can use

::

    balsam job --name ppo_test --workflow ppo_test --app PPO --num-nodes 11 --args '--evaluator balsam --run deephyper.search.nas.model.tensorflow1x.run.alpha.run --problem naspb.pblp.problem_skip_co_0.Problem --ent-coef 0.01 --noptepochs 10 --network ppo_lnlstm_128 --gamma 1.0 --lam 0.95 --max-evals 1000000'

::

where the ``--num-nodes 11`` argument specifies that there should be 11 agent nodes for PPO (please refer to the details of the PPO algorithm for a greater understanding here). As a default, each agent has an equal number of worker nodes that is decided according to the total number of nodes accessible during the submission of the job. For example if we submit this job as follows:

::

    balsam submit-launch -n 128 -q default -t 180 -A $PROJECT_NAME --job-mode mpi --wf-filter ppo_test

::

we have specified 128 nodes out of which 11 are agents, leaving us with 117 nodes to be equally distributed among the 11 agents. Since the number of free nodes is not perfectly divisible by 11, we are left with a remainder of 7 nodes that are unused while each agent has 10 worker nodes.

In contrast for EVO, the ``num-nodes`` argument is kept restricted to 1 (for now) since it corresponds to running one evolutionary search with 127 nodes (assuming you have specified 128 nodes in the balsam submission). This looks like

::

    balsam job --name evo_test --workflow evo_test --app EVO --num-nodes 1 --args '--evaluator balsam --run deephyper.search.nas.model.tensorflow1x.run.alpha.run --problem naspb.pblp.problem_skip_co_0.Problem --max-evals 1000000'

::

and the submission of this job may be called by

::

    balsam submit-launch -n 128 -q default -t 180 -A $PROJECT_NAME --job-mode mpi --wf-filter evo_test

::
